# Spring Mass Damper System

## Dynamics
The SMDS consists of a mass attached to a wall by both a spring and a damper. The forces of motion are in the horizontal ($+x$, $-x$) direction, eliminating the effects of gravity on the equations. The figure below shows this system as well as the constants associated with both the spring and the damper.

> `b` : damping coefficient
> `F` : Force acting on block
> `x` : displacement of block
